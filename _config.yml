Over the past five years, I have established myself as a Data Engineer and Analyst, specializing in real-time data pipelines, ETL, and automation. I excel in data extraction, processing, and visualization, utilizing SQL, Python, Tableau, and Power BI. I've optimized data workflows using Apache Kafka, Spark, and cloud technologies like AWS and Azure. Additionally, I've developed and deployed machine learning models for predictive analytics and used Databricks for scalable data processing, enhancing my ability to transform complex data into actionable insights and comprehensive reports.  <br><br>
