  With around 4 years of hands-on experience as a Data Analyst, I specialize in extracting, processing, and visualizing data using an array of powerful tools 
  including SQL, Tableau, Python, AWS, M.S Excel, Power BI, and Databricks.  My journey has revolved around translating complex datasets into actionable insights 
  that drive strategic business decisions. Whether it's designing streamlined data pipelines, creating intuitive visualizations, or generating comprehensive reports. 
  I thrive on harnessing data's potential to optimize processes and deliver tangible results.
