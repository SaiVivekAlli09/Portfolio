### Projects

[AirBnB Price Prediction](https://github.com/SaiVivekAlli09/AirBnB-Price-Prediction)\
This project involves assessing the price of a new Airbnb hotel in the USA by considering factors such as location, amenities, rooms, and reviews. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb data and utilizing multiple machine learning techniques to predict listing prices. Through EDA, the project explored and analyzed the dataset to gain valuable insights into the variables and their relationships. By combining data exploration and machine learning methodologies, the project aimed to enhance understanding and accuracy in predicting Airbnb property prices, providing valuable information for hosts and users in the platform.

[Financial Risk Analysis: Credit Default Prediction](https://github.com/SaiVivekAlli09/Financial-Risk-Analysis-Credit-Default-Prediction)\
Analyzed a comprehensive dataset encompassing customer demographics, credit history, and financial behavior and built a advanced Credit Scoring and Default Prediction System utilizing machine learning techniques.Implemented k-fold cross-validation and ensemble methods to enhance model robustness and accuracy.Developed a predictive model to assess the creditworthiness of customers and forecast the likelihood of loan default which would provide informed lending decisions.

[Healthcare Patient Care Analytics](http://example.com/)\
Utilized predictive analytics to forecast disease outbreaks, identify high-risk patients, and personalize treatment plans for improved patient outcomes. Analyzed demographic data to reveal insights into the prevalence of diseases across different demographic groups and help in tailoring healthcare services accordingly. Utilizing text mining, we extracted valuable insights from unstructured data sources, such as patient notes and feedback. These insights enhanced patient care strategies but also optimized operational processes, ensuring that healthcare services were personalized, efficient, and aligned with the specific needs of the patient population.

[Currency Converter](https://github.com/SaiVivekAlli09/Currency-Converter)\
Currency Converter web application allows users to convert US Dollars (USD) to other selected currencies such as Euro (EUR) and British Pound (GBP). When the user enters an amount in USD and selects a currency from the dropdown menu, the application fetches the latest exchange rates using an API. Upon clicking the "Convert" button, the application calculates the converted amount based on the selected currency and displays the result on the screen. 

[Slot Machine](https://github.com/SaiVivekAlli09/Python-Slot-Machine-Casino)\
Slot Machine using Python project is a text-based simulation where users deposit an initial amount of money. They can then choose to bet on one, two, or three lines of the slot machine. After placing their bet, the program determines if they win any lines. If they do, their bet is multiplied by the value of the winning line, and the winnings are added to their balance. Users can continue playing, placing new bets and spinning the slots, until they decide to cash out or run out of money. The game provides an interactive experience, allowing players to enjoy the excitement of a slot machine without the need for a graphical interface.
