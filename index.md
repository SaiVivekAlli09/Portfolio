 [AirBnB Price Prediction](https://github.com/SaiVivekAlli09/AirBnB-Price-Prediction)\
This project involves assessing the price of a new Airbnb hotel in the USA by considering factors such as location, amenities, rooms, and reviews. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb data and utilizing multiple machine learning techniques to predict listing prices. Through EDA, the project explored and analyzed the dataset to gain valuable insights into the variables and their relationships. Subsequently, various machine learning approaches were applied to predict Airbnb listing prices. By combining data exploration and machine learning methodologies, the project aimed to enhance understanding and accuracy in predicting Airbnb property prices, providing valuable information for hosts and users in the platform.

- [Healthcare Patient Care Analytics](http://example.com/)
Utilized predictive analytics to forecast disease outbreaks, identify high-risk patients, and personalize treatment plans for improved patient outcomes. Analyzed demographic data to reveal insights into the prevalence of diseases across different demographic groups and help in tailoring healthcare services accordingly. Utilizing text mining, we extracted valuable insights from unstructured data sources, such as patient notes and feedback. These insights enhanced patient care strategies but also optimized operational processes, ensuring that healthcare services were personalized, efficient, and aligned with the specific needs of the patient population.
