In my recent role at Apex IT Systems Global, I led a crucial initiative to enhance business processes for Takeda Pharmaceuticals, focusing on the Takhzyro project. Our goal was to streamline communication between Sales reps and healthcare providers (HCPs) regarding Takeda’s products for treating HAE patients. We consolidated valuable data on Databricks, enabling Sales reps to target HCPs at risk of discontinuing the product, thus fostering awareness.

To achieve this, we set up a systematic data flow, ingesting leads from Symphony/Prognos to Axtria, then to Takeda's EDB (AWS S3) using Datameer for scheduled data ingestion. Data transformations and analyses were performed, generating insights on potential HCP discontinuation risk. These insights were shared with Sales reps, validated with Axtria, and integrated into Takeda’s iengage application. Feedback from the Sales reps highlighted a significant 89% effectiveness in improving HCP engagement. Additionally, dashboards in Tableau provided valuable KPI metrics, showcasing the impact of these data-driven suggestions.

Currency Converter web application allows users to convert US Dollars (USD) to other selected currencies such as Euro (EUR) and British Pound (GBP). When the user enters an amount in USD and selects a currency from the dropdown menu, the application fetches the latest exchange rates using an API. Upon clicking the "Convert" button, the application calculates the converted amount based on the selected currency and displays the result on the screen. 

[Slot Machine](https://github.com/SaiVivekAlli09/Python-Slot-Machine-Casino)\
Slot Machine using Python project is a text-based simulation where users deposit an initial amount of money. They can then choose to bet on one, two, or three lines of the slot machine. After placing their bet, the program determines if they win any lines. If they do, their bet is multiplied by the value of the winning line, and the winnings are added to their balance. Users can continue playing, placing new bets and spinning the slots, until they decide to cash out or run out of money. The game provides an interactive experience, allowing players to enjoy the excitement of a slot machine without the need for a graphical interface.
