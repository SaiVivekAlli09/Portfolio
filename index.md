### Projects 

[Secure Document Storage Platform using InterPlanetary File System](https://github.com/KSR4599/Doc-Keeper)\
A full-stack application on top of MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack technology that uses IPFS to store confidential documents in
an encrypted fashion. This is an incentivized Ethereum based platform that uses eth as a token to make use of the storage benefits.

[Complete Balancing Algorithm using Rotations](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)\
Designed a self-optimization algorithm with three phases to reduce the number of performed rotations on Binary Trees consisting of 1000,1100
and 1200 nodes at each phase. Phase 1 transformed an arbitrary binary tree into a skewed binary tree and then to a Completely Balanced Binary Tree. Phase 2 and phase 3 are more intense where we show tighter upper bounds and obtain a close lower bound on the rotation distance between a zig-zag tree and a completely balanced tree.

[Bad Roads â€“ A Social Media Platform](https://github.com/KSR4599/resdem)\
A MEAN stack application, that enables the users to upload pictures and videos of the bad roads in their neighborhood along with geo-tagging services offered by Google API.

[Inter-Modal Transportation Platform](https://github.com/KSR4599/Hyp_Intermodal-trans)\
An Inter-Modal Transportation platform built using Hyperledger Fabric and Composer. The application is containerized using Docker and scaled using Kubernetes on the Google Cloud Platform and Digital Ocean.

[Bitcoin Based Land Registry System](https://github.com/KSR4599/Blockchain-Land-Registry-System.)\
Built a bitcoin-based land registry system that enables users to buy/bid/sell their properties. The platform is built using Node.js, Handlebars, Web-Sockets and Bootstrap.

[Security Surveillance Network to detect un-usual human activity](http://example.com/)\
Trained a Convolutional Neural Network which can be employed in surveillance systems to detect un-usual human activity.

[Dynamic Student Survey Forms, Department Course Catalog](http://example.com/)\
Created multiple full stack projects by upgrading technologies each time, implemented these projects using JavaScript, JQuery UI, AJAX, HTML and CSS for the front end, Node.js/ Express for the middleware and JPA, JDBC, JSP for the server side. I have containerized this application using docker and deployed it into GCP using KUbernetes for scaling/orchestration purposes.
